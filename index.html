          In the 1930s, people loved to play board games. Many games that are widely played today were invented in this decade. Some include <em>Sorry!</em> (1934), <em>Scrabble</em> (1938), and even <em>Monopoly</em> (1933)! In addition, songs were being spread by the selling of sheet music, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" target="_blank">Vaudeville</a> (a kind of play), and radio. TV was just becoming a thing, so families often spent the evening listening to the radio. TV in the early 1930s was mechanical or electro-mechanical, but later in the decade, the first fully electric television sets were being experimented with.

          The most popular sport in the U.S. from this time period was football. When the local team won a game, it was often celebrated by the whole community. In addition, children back then enjoyed games that we still use today such as tag and hide-and-seek.

          The first films were made in the mid to late 1880's. Back then, people would have to individually view films by looking through a device called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope" target="_blank">kinteoscope,</a> invented by Thomas Edison. By the 1910's, people would watch them in a movie theater called a nickelodeon.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1916, the first version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" target="_blank">Technicolor</a> was first invented. They could use two colors: red and green. They could be blended together to create different shades, too, But in 1928, the "three-strip" system proved to be even better. They were made by soaking three strips of different color films in dye, then putting them together. The first movie made completely with this technique, along with a synchronized score and sound effects, was <em>The Viking</em> (1929). After that, many "talkie" films were made with all of its sound completely synchronized.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1931, an improvement was made that removed much of the grain that resulted from this method. Some of these improved films included <em>Manhattan Parade</em> (1932), <em>Doctor X</em> (1932), and <em>Mystery of the Wax Museum</em> (1933). Unfortunately, around this time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" target="_blank">The Great Depression</a> hurt the film industry. This caused several companies, like Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn to cancel their upcoming color releases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Soon, Disney was also making their films in color. Their first color production was a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_Symphony" target="_blank">Silly Symphony,</a> Flowers and Trees</em> (1932). They used the improved version of Technicolor, and continued to make all their other <em>Silly Symphonies</em> with Technicolor. Merian C. Cooper, the director of <em>King Kong</em>, said that he never wanted to make another film in black and white after seeing one. After 1937, when an even better improved version of Technicolor especially for cartoons was invented, Disney adapted to make their films with it. It created its first feature-length film, <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em> (1937) with it, and used it thereafter for a long time until it improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not soon after the Great Depression, Hollywood was still wary about making their live-action films in Technicolor. After <em>The World Outside</em> (1934), Hollywood continued to film in Technicolor. Technicolor did, however, have many difficulties. In <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> (1937), there was a huge required amount of lighting, and the heavier-clothed actors had to have an increased water intake, and some even claimed to have gotten permanent eye damage! In addition, it costed lots to send film to Technicolor to dye it. That is how another company, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak" target="_blank">Eastman Kodak</a> (known now as Kodak), attracted clients to their less expensive method that would allow more compact film of only 35 millimeters.

          The Great Depression was one of the highest points in terms of readership. Many people became authors and made money to do more than support a family. Boys prefered action comics such as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Comics" target="_blank">Action Comics</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Comics" target="_blank">Detective Comics</a></em>. <em>Action Comics</em> included <em>Superman,</em> which made its debut in 1938. <em>Detective Comics</em> introduced <em>Batman</em> in 1937. <em>Detective Comics</em> is now known as DC Comics.

        <p>
          Mystery novels were the most popular for most people. Other popular books during the Depression included hopeful stories about ending the Depression, as well as hard-luck stories about unfortunate people during the depression. In addition, popular books today that were written in the 1930s included <em>The Hobbit</em> (1937), <em>The Hardy Boys</em> and <em>Nancy Drew</em> (all decade), the <em>Little House</em> books (1932-1939), <em>Mr. Popper's Penguins</em> (1938), and many more.

          As we all know, the average American watches TV, Youtube, Netflix, and many other video services. These have been around in some way or another in the 1930s as well. Television sets have evolved into high-tech electronic machines. As mentioned in <a href="#lesiure-then">Lesiure Then,</a> they used to be completely mechanical. Now they use exclusively electrical systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, computers are a major form of entertainment. However, it wasn't always like this. The first form of computer, the "difference engine," invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage,</a> was capable of calculating numbers to the eighth decimal place. It was steam-powered and Babbage said it was more of a "proof-of-concept" model and was soon being funded by the Royal Society in England. He started a new project: the Analytical Machine. He did not finish it, but he is commonly known as the "father of computers." He also created the first form of programming, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marie_Jacquard" target="_blank">Joseph Marie Jaquard's</a> punch cards made for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom" target="_blank">Jaquard loom.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Until the late 1960's and early 1970's, computers were extremely expensive and limited to governments and extremely sucessful and wealthy businesses for calculating coordinates for ballistic missles, expenses, and other things. These had to be programmed directly by flipping switches to change <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a> of memory. Soon, assembly programming languages were starting to make their appearance and greatly simplified a computer operator's job by changing the binary input into simple phrases and symbols that did specific functions. High-level programming languages make full use of English phrases and are the easiest to program with. Some that you may be familiar with are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript,</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)")C,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#,</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python.</a>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to being more capable, computers have drastically reduced in size. Now, over one-third of the whole world population have a smartphone, and 95% of Americans are smartphone users. Much of everyday lesiure is spent on social media and other mobile applications. It is projected that by 2020, there will be about five billion smartphone users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Computers have come a long way from 1937 when Bell Labratories created a demonstration <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)" target="_blank">binary adder</a> to now, when robots are doing work in factories and most people have a smartphone.

          Motion picture is still very popular as it was in the 1930s, and now even moreso. Sites such as Youtube, Netflix, and other streaming sites make it possible to watch almost anywhere with internet. Now, since television has been broadcasted, series have become even more popular than movies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter">Screenwriters</a> are now able to have longer continuous stories because of the availability to watch. People could only go to the movies to see a single movie, and especially during the Great Depression, they couldn't afford to keep seeing an ongoing series. It would also be costly to the producer to film or animate more than a few hours of content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Television and movies have come a long way. They used to all be either hand-drawn or filmed, but within the last fifty years, film production has a new option: computer animation. This has been used to render more precise graphics than hand-drawn animations, and can be used to enhance live action movies. The renderings can look very realistic movies as well. A wide selection of movies are now fully computer-animated, including Pixar and Dreamworks.

					Reading has been a persistent practice for several centuries. Today, it has increased tremendously because of such high literacy rate. In the 1930s, the literacy rate was only about 33%, while today it is about 86.3%. In the year 1800, it had even been as low as 12%. This increase is due to an increase in education around the world.
